                        <h2>STORY</h2>
                        <p>She was the daughter of a shaman who had great fighting skills. These abilities were envied by her brothers, who decided to get together to kill her. She resisted and fought back, killing them all. Afraid of her father's reaction, who was a shaman, she ran away. The father eventually found her and decided to throw her between the rivers Negro and Solimões. She was saved by the fish and transformed into Iara during a full moon night.

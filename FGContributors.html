            <h1>MONTEIRO LOBATO</h1> <!--<h5>(1882-1948)</h5>-->
            <p>Monteiro Lobato was one of Brazil's most influential writers, mostly for his children's books set in the fictional S&iacutetio do Picapau Amarelo ("Yellow Woodpecker Farm"). <br><br>
                Sítio do Picapau Amarelo was a small farm in the countryside, featuring the elderly ranch owner Dona Benta ("Mrs. Benta"), her two grandchildren - L&uacutecia and Narizinho ("Little Nose", because she had a turned-up nose) and a boy, Pedrinho ("Little Pete") - and a black servant and cook, Tia Nast&aacutecia ("Aunt Anastacia").<br><br>
                These real characters were complemented by entities created by the children's imagination: the rag doll Em&iacutelia ("Emilia") and the learned puppet made of corncob Visconde de Sabugosa (roughly "Viscount Corncob"), the cow Mocha, the donkey Conselheiro ("Counsellor"), the pig Rabic&oacute ("Short-Tail") and the rhinoceros Quindim (Quindim is a Brazilian dessert), Saci Perer&ecirc (a black, pipe-smoking, one-legged character of Brazilian folklore) and Cuca (an evil monster that kidnaps children at night). <br>

            <h1>M&#193RIO DE ANDRADE</h1>
            <p>The critic M&aacuterio de Andrade, who specialized in studying Brazilian folklore, became a staunch supporter of "modernist" Brazilian artists who incorporated folkloric material into their work, a process he began in the 1920s in his music and in his paradigmatic work, Macuna&iacutema (1928). His observation that certain classical tunes had been transformed into popular pieces prompted a great deal of interest.
                <br><br>
                He was a novelist, poet, storyteller, chronicler, literature and art critic, photographer and scholar of Brazilian folklore. One of the founders of the 1922 Modern Art Week, he launched Pauliceia Desvairada, poetry in the same year, a milestone in Brazilian modernism.
                <br><br>
                M&aacuterio valued artistic and cultural manifestations in Brazil, dedicating himself to searching for the defining elements of the national identity.

            <h1>C&AtildeMARA CASCUDO </h1>
            <p>Lu&iacutes da C&acircmara Cascudo became one of the main folklorists and researchers of the country's ethnic roots, being the author of a vast literature on the subject. He compiled a copious collection of folk and popular songs and legends.
                <br><br>
                His legacy stilll lives, for his performance in institutions, for the collection, systematization and dissemination of a vast amount of popular and erudite sources that are, until today, a rich material for appreciation and study, for the documentation of countless forms and cultural expressions on the verge of disappearing, avoiding their oblivion, by valuing and systematically studying folklore in a period when it was discredited by erudite culture.

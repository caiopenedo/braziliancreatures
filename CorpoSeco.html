                        <p>In Paran√° (a state in Brazil), Corpo-Seco was a man who had promised to walk to the city of Aparecida do Norte if he became rich. When he got rich, he didn't keep his promise and took a plane instead. In another version, the man would have died during the trip.<br><br> Today, at the place where the man was buried, truck drivers passing by are surprised by someone knocking on the window, asking for a ride to Aparecida do Norte. But when they arrive at the place where the Dry Body had the accident, the person who had asked for a ride disappears from the truck.
